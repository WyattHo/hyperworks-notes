# hyperworks-notes

## What is this repository about?
I am using markdown format here to organize various notes on [Altair HyperWorks](https://altair.com/hyperworks) that I have learned. 

## How does it work?
The original content of these notes is located in the `src` folder, and the images used are stored in the `img` folder. Additionally, whenever I update the markdown content and push it to GitHub, the content is automatically transferred to the HackMD platform using a **GitHub workflow** that I have set up with [HackMD API](https://hackmd.io/@hackmd-api/developer-portal/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40hackmd-api%2FrkoVeBXkq?utm_source=settings-api&utm_medium=inline-cta).
